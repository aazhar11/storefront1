          <p>In this assignment we use a responsive Design approach in order to create the website for Mobile Phones. Responsive Design is used in the creation of web pages using flexible layouts, images and cascading style. It is an approach to assemble a site with the goal that it naturally scales its substance and components to coordinate the screen size on which it is seen. For example it keeps the images from being larger than the screen size. Basically, responsive design in web technology means that the design and the layout of the website should respond to the user’s screen size layout, it's orientation and platform it is being used at.</p>
          
          <p>Basically, responsive design in web technology means that the design and the layout of the website should respond to the user’s screen size layout, it's orientation and platform it is being used at. Web pages can take advantage of responsive design by making the websites more flexible and easier to read on every screen type. In order to accomplish this responsive design in this assignment, a CSS file was used. In the CSS file, flexible layouts/structural elements like, header, footer, nav, section, aside, classes and body section were used. For example, the techniques that were used include background position, background attachment (set to scroll instead of fixed, to make the image flexible according to screen resolution), margin, padding and border.  Positioning and display properties (i.e. table, table-caption) were also used.</p>
          
          <p>This assignment helped me with the understanding of how to build web pages for different  devices(tablets, laptops, smartphones). For example, if you want to build a web page for certain device, we have to use padding, height and width of the body container, margins and border(border-radius) and it’s float value(determine where it will on the page(i.e right/left)) and positioning in order to develop a responsive design website.</p>
